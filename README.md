Url Shortener Project

This project was done by Anirudh Venkata Ganesh Mangudy

the main obejective of this poject was to produce small url so that it would be benefitial for the usage of the proplr,hence
in this project i have implemented the url shortener where when u give a full url and a note and it returns a shorturl which
can be used anywhere and is of a much smaller length and makes it easy for sharing and posting
I have also implemented the search function where if u have already shortened the url then just with the node u can receive
the shortened url even without the full url,u can input any one of the three fullurl,note,shorturl to get the remaining fields from the database

As an optional task i have also implemented to check how many times has the shorturl been used and clicked and is stored in the database
i have also hosted the website so that thits url shortener webiste can be used from anyhwere and can be used by all the poeple in the world using the render app
